# Recipe Public API - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive public API system for recipes that follows the same intelligent pattern as the existing Yeast, Hop, and Malt public APIs, with enhanced features for community consultation and advanced brewing assistance.

## Architecture

### 1. Controller Layer
**File:** `/app/interfaces/controllers/recipes/RecipePublicController.scala`

The main controller provides comprehensive endpoints for:
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced search with intelligent filtering
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Multiple recommendation algorithms
- **Recipe Analysis & Comparison**: Side-by-side comparisons and custom analysis
- **Brewing Tools**: Recipe scaling, brewing guides, alternatives
- **Community Features**: Statistics, collections, trending recipes

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
**File:** `/app/application/recipes/dtos/RecipePublicDTOs.scala`

Comprehensive DTO system including:
- `RecipePublicDTO`: Core recipe representation for public API
- `RecipeDetailResponseDTO`: Full recipe details with brewing guide
- `RecipeRecommendationDTO`: Intelligent recommendation with scoring
- `RecipeSearchResponseDTO`: Search results with facets and suggestions
- Advanced DTOs for comparisons, scaling, analysis, and community features

### 3. Advanced Filtering System
**File:** `/app/domain/recipes/model/RecipePublicFilter.scala`

Sophisticated filtering capabilities:
- **Basic Filters**: Name, style, difficulty
- **Parameter Filters**: ABV, IBU, SRM ranges
- **Ingredient Filters**: Include/exclude specific ingredients
- **Equipment Filters**: Equipment type, brewing method, fermentation type
- **Time Filters**: Brewing time, fermentation time constraints
- **Community Filters**: Popularity, tags, seasonal availability

### 4. Recommendation Engine
**File:** `/app/domain/recipes/services/RecipeRecommendationService.scala`

Intelligent recommendation algorithms:
- **Beginner Recommendations**: Simple recipes with basic techniques
- **Style-based Recommendations**: Recipes matching specific beer styles
- **Ingredient-based Recommendations**: Based on available ingredient inventory
- **Seasonal Recommendations**: Appropriate for current season
- **Progression Recommendations**: Next-level recipes for skill development
- **Alternative Recommendations**: When original ingredients unavailable

## Integration Points

### Advanced Calculations
The API integrates with `BrewingCalculatorService` for:
- Real-time parameter calculations (OG, FG, ABV, IBU, SRM)
- Recipe balance analysis
- Nutritional information
- Water chemistry considerations

### Existing Domain Services
- **Hop Recommendations**: Cross-references with hop availability and characteristics
- **Malt Recommendations**: Integrates malt selection with recipe requirements  
- **Yeast Recommendations**: Matches yeast strains with recipe parameters

### Repository Integration
- Uses existing `RecipeReadRepository` for data access
- Optimized queries for search and filtering
- Pagination support for large result sets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Data Models

### Core Recipe Representation
```scala
case class RecipePublicDTO(
  id: String,
  name: String,
  description: Option[String],
  style: BeerStyleDTO,
  batchSize: BatchSizeDTO,
  difficulty: String,
  estimatedTime: EstimatedTimeDTO,
  ingredients: RecipeIngredientsDTO,
  calculations: RecipeCalculationsPublicDTO,
  characteristics: RecipeCharacteristicsDTO,
  tags: List[String],
  popularity: Double,
  createdAt: Instant,
  updatedAt: Instant
)
```

### Filtering System
```scala
case class RecipePublicFilter(
  name: Option[String] = None,
  style: Option[String] = None,
  difficulty: Option[DifficultyLevel] = None,
  minAbv: Option[Double] = None,
  maxAbv: Option[Double] = None,
  // ... comprehensive filtering options
  sortBy: RecipeSortBy = RecipeSortBy.Relevance,
  page: Int = 0,
  size: Int = 20
)
```

### Recommendation System
```scala
case class RecommendedRecipe(
  recipe: RecipeAggregate,
  score: Double,
  reason: String,
  tips: List[String],
  matchFactors: List[String]
)
```

## Security & Validation

### Input Validation
- Parameter range validation (ABV 0-20%, IBU 0-200, etc.)
- Text input sanitization and length limits
- Pagination bounds enforcement
- SQL injection prevention

### Public API Safety
- Only published recipes accessible
- No user-specific data exposure
- Rate limiting considerations
- Error message sanitization

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Recipe details caching for popular recipes
- Search result caching for common queries
- Recommendation algorithm result caching
- Facet calculation caching

### Query Optimization
- Indexed search on common filter fields
- Optimized pagination with cursor-based approach
- Batch loading for related data
- Efficient scoring algorithm implementations

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Responses
- Structured error messages with codes
- Input validation error details
- Helpful suggestions for corrections
- Graceful degradation for partial failures

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid filter parameters",
  "details": [
    "ABV minimum cannot be greater than maximum",
    "Batch size must be positive"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Check your ABV range values",
    "Ensure batch size is greater than 0"
  ]
}
```
